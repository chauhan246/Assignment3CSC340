    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p class="extra-large-font-size">
        We are a privately owned business in Greensboro, NC. Our first shop was opened
        in 1998 in the downtown area near the court house. With every sell made, we donate
        15 % to the local food bank. Our mission is to spread love and build a loving community
        where we can all enjoy a little bit of chocolate and love for one another. We are recently
        working on opening a new shop in Raleigh, NC. Please visit us often for updates and 
        promotions coming up.
